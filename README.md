# Alarm Clock Application

This is a simple alarm clock application implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is organized into different files to improve readability and maintainability.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the alarm clock interface.
- **alarms.js**: The JavaScript file responsible for managing alarms. It includes utility functions, alarm form handling, and alarm list management.

### JavaScript Files

- **alarmUtils.js**: Contains utility functions for validating input.
- **alarmForm.js**: Manages the functionality related to setting alarms through the form.
- **alarmList.js**: Handles the display of alarms, deletion, and checking for active alarms.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Set alarms using the input form.
3. View the list of alarms displayed on the page.
4. The clock updates every second, and if an alarm time matches the current time, an alert will be triggered.
